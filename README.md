Demo of annoying bug with effect of sporadic app crashing!

Context: iOS 7, iPad 3!

Symptoms: do fast scrolling up and down for about 15 seconds or more â€¦ App will crash!

Empirically proven: bug appears if scroll view bounce is enabled and if collection view data is periodically reloading (see code)!
